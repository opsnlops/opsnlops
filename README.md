Hello! I'm April. I'm an engineer, but not the cool kind of engineer that drives trains. I'm the kind of engineer that stops computers from beating each other up.

My day job is being an Engineering Manager. That means that it's my job to herd highly intelligent cats that really do not wish to be herded.

I'm teaching myself all about animatronics! The most active repos on my GitHub account are the code that I use to power my studio, [April's Creature Workshop](https://creature.engineering)! I have a goal of some day working on animatronics for a living, and my website is my portfolio.
